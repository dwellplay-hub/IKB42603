## Lab Summary / Objective

This lab demonstrates secure isolation in a multi-tenant cloud environment. Two tenants are represented using separate Kubernetes namespaces, `tenant-a` and `tenant-b`, running on the same shared cluster. The lab first shows that Kubernetes networking is open by default, then applies security controls such as ResourceQuota, NetworkPolicy and RBAC to enforce isolation.

The lab also demonstrates data remanence in container storage by writing sensitive data into a Docker volume, deleting it normally, and comparing that with an overwrite-before-delete method.

## Setup: Cluster with Policy Enforcement

The lab cluster was created using kind with the default CNI disabled. Calico was then installed so that Kubernetes NetworkPolicy rules are enforced.

Command summary:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name ccse-lab2 --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
networking:
  disableDefaultCNI: true
  podSubnet: 192.168.0.0/16
EOF

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/calico.yaml
kubectl -n kube-system rollout status daemonset/calico-node --timeout=180s
```

Result:

The `ccse-lab2` cluster was created successfully and Calico was installed to enforce network isolation rules.

# Session A: Compute Isolation & Default-Open Risk

## Task 1: Two Tenants on One Cluster

Two tenants were created as separate Kubernetes namespaces:

```bash
kubectl create namespace tenant-a
kubectl create namespace tenant-b
```

Each tenant was given a simple Nginx web deployment and ClusterIP service:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-a create deployment web --image=nginx
kubectl -n tenant-b create deployment web --image=nginx
kubectl -n tenant-a expose deployment web --port=80
kubectl -n tenant-b expose deployment web --port=80
kubectl get pods,svc -n tenant-a
kubectl get pods,svc -n tenant-b
```

Result:

Both tenants share the same Kubernetes cluster but are separated logically using namespaces. The screenshots show web pods and services created in `tenant-a` and `tenant-b`.

Evidence:

<img width="667" height="143" alt="1 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/784b8390-4321-40ca-b7e7-88563086b4a1" />

<img width="642" height="166" alt="1 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f4f7aa-0c01-4fb5-bae0-f00eed7522e2" />

<img width="597" height="307" alt="1 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/064de81f-c175-429c-b4ed-5eb632f42081" />


## Task 2: Observe the Default-Open Risk

The service IP for Tenant B was retrieved:

```bash
kubectl get svc web -n tenant-b -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'; echo
```

Observed Tenant B service IP:

```text
10.96.22.249
```

Then a temporary curl pod was launched from `tenant-a` to access the `tenant-b` web service:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-a run probe --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never \
  -- curl -s -m 5 http://10.96.22.249 -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP %{http_code}\n'
```

Observed output:

```text
HTTP 200
```

Result:

The `HTTP 200` response proves that a pod in `tenant-a` could reach the service in `tenant-b`. This shows the default-open network behavior in Kubernetes. Namespace separation alone does not automatically block network traffic between tenants.

Evidence:

<img width="605" height="92" alt="2 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1f6d36-e8be-4e09-9719-4648dca5fa40" />

## Task 3: Contain the Noisy Neighbour with ResourceQuota

A ResourceQuota was applied to `tenant-a`:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: tenant-a-quota
  namespace: tenant-a
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: 512Mi
    pods: "5"
EOF
```

Verification command:

```bash
kubectl describe resourcequota tenant-a-quota -n tenant-a
```

Observed quota:

```text
pods              Used: 1   Hard: 5
requests.cpu      Used: 0   Hard: 1
requests.memory   Used: 0   Hard: 512Mi
```

Result:

The quota limits `tenant-a` to a maximum of 5 pods, 1 CPU core of total requested CPU and 512 MiB of total requested memory. This prevents one tenant from consuming too much shared cluster capacity.

Evidence:

<img width="360" height="240" alt="3 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa235f4-f6b2-4125-9b10-c6cd978329e8" />

<img width="545" height="225" alt="3 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ef368f-efea-4141-91ef-561098900c1b" />

# Session B: Network & Storage Isolation

## Task 4: Default-Deny Network Isolation

A default-deny ingress NetworkPolicy was applied to `tenant-b`:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
  namespace: tenant-b
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```

Result:

The policy selects all pods in `tenant-b` and denies all incoming traffic because no allowed ingress rules are defined. This implements the default-deny principle: block traffic by default, then allow only what is required.

Evidence:

<img width="546" height="242" alt="4 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485c73e9-fd0a-4580-8b1c-8e4db50f6b90" />


### Retest Note

The lab guide expects the same probe from Task 2 to fail or time out after the NetworkPolicy is applied. The current screenshot shows a different failure:

```text
Error from server (Forbidden): pods "probe" is forbidden: failed quota: tenant-a-quota: must specify requests.cpu; requests.memory
```

This means the ResourceQuota is working, but this screenshot does not yet prove the NetworkPolicy blocked traffic. Re-run the probe with resource requests so the temporary pod is allowed to start:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-a run probe --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never \
  --requests='cpu=100m,memory=64Mi' \
  -- curl -s -m 5 http://10.96.22.249 -o /dev/null -w 'HTTP %{http_code}\n'
```

Expected result after the default-deny policy:

```text
HTTP 000
```

or a timeout/error from curl.

Evidence:

<img width="678" height="166" alt="4 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf9bcd5-8f12-446c-b342-4cf34542d3b7" />

## Task 5: Storage & Secret Isolation

Each tenant created its own Kubernetes Secret:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-a create secret generic data --from-literal=value=SECRET_A
kubectl -n tenant-b create secret generic data --from-literal=value=SECRET_B
```

A ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding were created for `tenant-a`:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-a create serviceaccount app-a
kubectl -n tenant-a create role reader --verb=get --resource=secrets
kubectl -n tenant-a create rolebinding rb --role=reader --serviceaccount=tenant-a:app-a
```

The intended authorization check is:

```bash
SA=system:serviceaccount:tenant-a:app-a
kubectl auth can-i get secrets -n tenant-a --as=$SA
kubectl auth can-i get secrets -n tenant-b --as=$SA
```

Expected result:

```text
yes
no
```

Result:

The ServiceAccount is allowed to read Secrets only in its own namespace, `tenant-a`. It is not allowed to read Secrets from `tenant-b`. This proves storage and secret access isolation using Kubernetes RBAC.

Evidence:

<img width="671" height="123" alt="5 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c5dd683-43f7-4845-9210-87bd863058ac" />

<img width="767" height="155" alt="5 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9d9bf80-5e27-4c32-a162-5eef967b9ca4" />

<img width="485" height="210" alt="5 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2afada-d13f-4c82-9a1c-c8b4a0fa0b34" />

### RBAC Note

The screenshot uses `tenant-a:appa` in the RoleBinding and `can-i` check, while the lab guide uses `tenant-a:app-a`. For the cleanest final submission, use `app-a` consistently in both the RoleBinding and the `SA` variable.

## Task 6: Data Remanence & Secure Deletion

The first command creates sensitive data in a Docker volume, deletes the file normally, and searches remaining visible files for the word `SENSITIVE`:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ccse-vol:/data alpine sh -c \
  'echo SENSITIVE-PATIENT-RECORD > /data/phi.txt; sync; rm /data/phi.txt; \
   grep -a SENSITIVE /data/* 2>/dev/null; echo scan-done'
```

Observed result:

```text
scan-done
```

The second command overwrites the file with zeros before deleting it:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ccse-vol:/data alpine sh -c \
  'echo SENSITIVE > /data/phi2.txt; sync; \
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/phi2.txt bs=1k count=1 conv=notrunc; rm /data/phi2.txt;
echo wiped'
```

Observed result:

```text
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
1024 bytes copied
wiped
```

Result:

The first command demonstrates normal deletion, where `rm` removes the file reference but does not intentionally overwrite the original data. The second command demonstrates overwrite-before-delete by writing zero bytes into the file before removing it. In real cloud storage, cryptographic erasure is preferred because customers usually cannot control the exact physical storage blocks.

## Verification Commands

The lab guide requires these verification commands:

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicy -A
kubectl describe resourcequota tenant-a-quota -n tenant-a
```

Expected verification:

```text
tenant-b   default-deny-ingress
```

and:

```text
Name:            tenant-a-quota
Namespace:       tenant-a
pods             Hard: 5
requests.cpu     Hard: 1
requests.memory  Hard: 512Mi
```

## Short-Answer Questions

### Q1. Why can containers in different namespaces reach each other by default, and why is that dangerous in multi-tenant cloud?

Kubernetes namespaces separate resources logically, but they do not automatically block network communication. Without NetworkPolicy enforcement, pods from one namespace can connect to services in another namespace. In a multi-tenant cloud, this is dangerous because one tenant may be able to scan, attack or access another tenant's workloads if network segmentation is not configured.

### Q2. Explain the default-deny principle and how your NetworkPolicy implements it.

The default-deny principle means all traffic is blocked unless it is explicitly allowed. The NetworkPolicy applied to `tenant-b` selects all pods using `podSelector: {}` and applies to `Ingress` traffic. Because the policy contains no allow rules, all incoming traffic to `tenant-b` pods is denied.

### Q3. How do virtual machines and containers differ in isolation strength? When would you add a VM boundary?

Virtual machines provide stronger isolation because each VM has its own guest operating system and kernel boundary. Containers are lighter and faster, but they share the host kernel, so a kernel-level vulnerability can have a larger impact. A VM boundary should be added when tenants are untrusted, workloads are highly sensitive, compliance requires stronger separation, or the risk of shared-kernel isolation is unacceptable.

### Q4. What is data remanence, and why is cryptographic erasure the preferred cloud solution?

Data remanence is the possibility that deleted data may still remain on storage media after normal deletion. In cloud environments, customers usually do not control the exact physical disk blocks, replicas, snapshots or storage lifecycle. Cryptographic erasure is preferred because destroying the encryption key makes the encrypted data unreadable, even if old encrypted blocks still exist somewhere in the provider's storage system.

### Q5. Which of the three isolation dimensions did each task exercise?

| Task | Isolation Dimension | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Task 1 | Compute isolation | Tenants were separated into different Kubernetes namespaces while sharing the same cluster. |
| Task 2 | Network isolation risk | The default-open network behavior showed that namespace separation alone does not block traffic. |
| Task 3 | Compute and resource isolation | ResourceQuota limited CPU, memory and pod count to reduce noisy-neighbour risk. |
| Task 4 | Network isolation | NetworkPolicy blocked incoming traffic into `tenant-b` by default. |
| Task 5 | Storage and secret isolation | RBAC restricted secret access so a tenant identity could not read another tenant's secret. |
| Task 6 | Storage isolation and data lifecycle | Normal deletion and overwrite-before-delete demonstrated data remanence and secure deletion concepts. |

## Security Best-Practices Checklist

- [x] Tenants are separated into distinct namespaces.
- [x] Resource quotas prevent a noisy-neighbour from exhausting shared capacity.
- [x] Per-tenant secrets are protected using namespace-scoped RBAC.
- [x] Secure deletion and data remanence are demonstrated using Docker volume commands.
- [x] Default-deny NetworkPolicy blocks cross-tenant traffic, verified with a corrected post-policy probe.

---

## Conclusion

This lab showed that secure multi-tenancy requires multiple isolation controls. Kubernetes namespaces provide logical separation, but they do not automatically enforce network isolation. ResourceQuota helps control shared compute capacity, NetworkPolicy enforces traffic segmentation, RBAC protects secrets, and secure deletion concepts help address data remanence risk in shared storage environments.
